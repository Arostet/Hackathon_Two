This project is really creative!
 I like the use of an external api to get exercises for a workout! The use of localstorage is good too.
Orginised routes controllers and models folders in the node server.
The chat functionality is fantastic and done really well !!
User login register, replying with different responses (wrong password ect..) also very good.
You guys should be really proud of yourselves,
 you've made an amazing project together and show very high understanding of Javascript!
